<!-- LANDING PAGE / TEMPLATE -->
  <p>admin works!</p>

  <!-- Any landing page for a parent route path with children
      needs the router-outlet directive in order to render child
      paths -- so, admin/users only renders once you incorporate the
      below directive: -->
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
